# AutoHotkey Scripts for Switchvox Softphone

> TLDR; Scripts to control the Switchvox softphone using AutoHotkey

If you use Switchvox's softphone software in conjunction with their cloud or on-premise phone service, you may find yourself wishing you could use key combinations to do things like pick up a call, hang up or put a call on hold. There are no built-in hot keys for these functions.

I used the free tool [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) which is very extensive and flexible in letting you customize hot keys for your system. The main script file in the code listing contains 3 hotkeys as follows:

- WIN-SHIFT-A: Answer current incoming call.
- WIN-SHIFT-D: Disconnect/Hang-up on current call.
- WIN-SHIFT-H: Put current call on hold.

To use the script, make sure you have AutoHotkey installed first. Then double click on the script file to make it available to the operating system to use the hotkey, then try it out. If you want to make it launch when Windows logins, here are [instructions](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup) on how to do that.

You are free to modify the scripts to use different hotkey combinations that suit your needs.

Enjoy!
